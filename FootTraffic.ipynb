    "## Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors: Understanding Long-Term Traffic Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Eigenvalues and eigenvectors play a crucial role in understanding the long-term behavior of systems, such as foot traffic in our case. By analyzing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the normalized traffic matrix, we can predict how the distribution of people in different areas of the library stabilizes over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Mathematical Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between a matrix, its eigenvalues, and its eigenvectors is foundational in linear algebra and is expressed by the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A\\mathbf{v} = \\lambda\\mathbf{v}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this equation:\n",
    "- \\( A \\) represents our normalized traffic matrix.\n",
    "- \\( v \\) is an eigenvector of \\( A \\).\n",
    "- \\( λ \\) is the corresponding eigenvalue of \\( v \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation in Our Context\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Eigenvectors** \\( v )\\: These vectors provide the \"direction\" of the traffic flow in the long term. In our context, each eigenvector represents a possible pattern of how people distribute themselves across different areas of the library.\n",
    "- **Eigenvalues** \\( λ \\): These values indicate the \"magnitude\" or \"scaling factor\" for each eigenvector. A higher eigenvalue corresponds to a more dominant or likely traffic pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why It Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Steady State**: Over time, the foot traffic distribution tends to align with the eigenvector associated with the largest eigenvalue. This is because, as the matrix is repeatedly applied (akin to passing time), the contributions from other eigenvectors diminish relative to the dominant one.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Predictive Power**: By identifying this dominant eigenvector, we can predict the most likely long-term distribution of people across the library's areas, assuming current trends continue."
